ArduinoPinTests
===============

Sketches for testing Input and/or Output capabilities of designated pins of an Arduino or compatible board.

##Code
###Test2PinsIn.ino
This sketch tests two pins with the press of a button. Some physical assembly required; an example can be viewed in image ArduinoInPinsPhysicalConfigAnnotated.jpg in repo. Code modifications also required to indicate which pins to test.

###Test6PinsOut.ino
This sketch tests six pins with the press of a button. Some physical assembly required; an example can be viewed in image ArduinoOutPinsPhysicalConfigAnnotated.jpg in repo. Code modifications also required to indicate which pins to test.

Please feel free to use/abuse/reuse this code and information as desired, but doing so is at your sole discretion and risk!
